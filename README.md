## About  

This project aims to develop a cryptocurrency using Python programming language. Please keep in mind that it's not a implementation of any exisiting cryptocurrency. 

## Key Points to note

1. Rather than executing python scripts on different machines, I have run the python scripts on the same machine but on different ports.
